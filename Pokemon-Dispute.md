**Basic Workflow**:

The major task is a game, in which ash and pickachu play against each other. There are four rectangular boxes on the screen, ash selects a box then pickachu selects a box, the color of the box selected by ash should get changed to blue and the box selected by pickachu should get changed to yellow. then they click a reveal button, which generates random numbers from 1-30 in all the four boxes, the number in the box selected by ash is the points scored by ash and the number in the box selected by pickachu will pickachu's score.
Play for a least of 4 rounds and decide the winner. **[100 points]**

**Subtasks**:

1. Make a toss feature, for selecting who starts the game, the one who wins the toss makes the first choice. **[50 points]**

2. Display the name and score of both parties on the screen everytime. **[50 points]**

3. Display the winner in a Dialog box. **[30 points]**

4. Make the app fixed in portrait mode. The app should not rotate on rotating screens. **[10 points]**
